## Instructions
- Use the arrow keys(Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the player.
- Try to reach the top without colliding with the bugs.
- There are five lives. Each time you collide with a bug a life is lost. 
- If you loose all five lives, the game ends.

## How I created the project
I built the project using javascript object oriented programming, HTML5 and CSS.
